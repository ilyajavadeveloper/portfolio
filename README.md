Ilya Java Devs — Portfolio

A personal portfolio built with React and Vite, designed to showcase projects, skills, and aesthetics through clean code and minimal design.

Overview
This site is a reflection of both craft and style — a space where I combine front-end engineering with visual storytelling. Each project in the portfolio highlights a different aspect of my work — from modern UI design to performant React architecture.
